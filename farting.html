            <h2>Farting</h2>
            Farting is an essential day to day activity. It helps maintain a healthy lifestyle and keeps bloating away.
            There are multiple types of farts, but the most common way to categorize them is by the loudness/stinkyness ratio.
            Essentially, the louder the fart, the less stinky (fully silent farts are the most nocive for surrounding victims).
            Farting can be enjoyed alone or can be turned into a group activity.
