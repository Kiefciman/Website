## D&D Campaign

### 21.11.2023

I lived in a poor village back then. There weren't any career options for me really. Future didn't seem bright at all. That's when I decided I'll get away, move to a town or city, where I could have more opportunities. With only a few gold in my pocket, I left my village and headed west. After a few days of travelling on foot, I arrived at the town of Neverfell. During these days of traveling, I was thinking about what I'll gonna do when I'll arrive there. I decided I'll become an adventurer.

The first thing I did when I arrived at Neverfell was to buy some adequate equipment for my adventuring. Then I went to an inn to seek an experienced adventurer who would train me. I found someone. His name was Bardon. He asked for 50 GP as price for my training. I didn't really have much gold after buying all that equipment so I tried to persuade him. He refused any offer I made, so I had to accept his. He said we'll start the training the next day. This deal left me with almost no gold, so I decided I'll sleep in a barn until I'll get money. Luckily, I found a farmer, Liang, who was willing to rent me his barn for 1 SP/ night. After a week of training, I felt like I have more strenght and endurance than ever before. I decided it was time to test my new abilities. I went to the inn to look for a beginner friendly quest announcement. I saw one saying there were 2 small slimes spotted near the town's SE wall. I thought it was easy enough. I went to the innkeeper saying that I accept that quest, then I left the inn, heading towards the slimes. I easily defeated them both and brought back a sample from both to the innkeeper as proof. Cordelia, the innkeeper said she also heard townfolks in the inn talking about me slaying the times, so she believed me. She marked the quest as finished and handed me 10 GP as reward. I bought an ale and some meat to celebrate. 

The next day I went to the inn again to take a quest from the questboard. I accepted one that required slaying some rats that infested the fields in a nearby village. Took a whole day to arrive to that village, Hamer, so l decided I'll sleep there that night. There were rooms to rent in the local Inn for 5 SP/night. Next day I went to investigate the fields. There were no workers there, only rats everywhere. I killed them all, but they were so many, it almost costed my life. Looks like I underestimated them, when they are many, they can be worthy opponents. I planned to go hunting after I finish with the rats, but I must rest today. Next morning I headed home. I arrived at night, but the inn was still open, so I collected my reward, 4 GP.
